This project is part of an online course I'm taking to learn Flutter, where the focus is on understanding concepts like **widgets**, `StatefulWidget`, and `StatelessWidget` classes. We created a digital dice rolling simulation as part of the course curriculum, providing a practical opportunity to explore these concepts interactively. Through this project, I aim to gain a deeper understanding of managing widget states and creating dynamic user interfaces in Flutter.
